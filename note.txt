those html file are working but compare each other, the app.html fils was workimg but doesnt have a page at the profile page, unlike at the app2.html it has a profile page and can efit the edit information button but the problem it the other buttons at the main page are not working

on the main page of the employee it will bee the application of the applied applicants at bottom noav of the employee main page instead of "saved jobs" it should be "saved applicant application" something like that. and at the applications when the user(employee) click the appwoved or reject r save button, it will be removed to the list and will go at the saved applicants, and when I click the schedule interview a new page will show and it has a form for a number of the applicant that is from the resume, a mesage on where, what, how, when will be the interview will take plce and who the employee is

task for this week (Done)
- after clicking the button sign up(when the user fill up correctly all the form there), it should go back to the log in page where the the user should log in the signed up account.
- the user nav button at the top, for example when the user click only the [tech] button it will only show any open job taht is related to technical.
- when the user is applicant and login its account, and when it click the employee page it should not be open since the user was an applicant. or when logging in, when the user created/ sign up an account, the page wehre the user need to choose if the user was a employer or an applicant should only show when signing up after signed up, the user will log in the created account and then when succesfuly log in it ill automatically log at the applicant side

needed to fix (Done)
- at the profile section, the resume should be changeable
- at the profile section, there should be also a address of the user where, the user be able to edit it anytime.
- also when the user (employee) approve, reject or save an application of the applicants it will be sent ot the applicant phone number that is at the resumer or at the application filled up on submitting the application form of the applicant
- also when the employee click the schedule interview button a page will show where in the employee can input abouts the meeting of the interview such as when, where, what etc. and send button so that when the employee was done on inputing the details about the meeting the message will be send to the applicant submitted mobiel number.

New problems
- at the employer main page, when the user click the save button, the application of the applicant will go to the save for interviews and at the save interview when done scheduled for the interview it will be remove to the list of the save applicants and will display like a notification card where in just a reminder where in this applicantg have been already scheduled a interview.
- at the main page of the employee when clicking the button [View details] of the applicant instead of opening it like a card, it should be open a new page for that details, just klike when opening the other navigations, that opens a new page for taht information.
- at the interview details the applicant name is not editable
- at the profile page, when I upload a resume the user will see its resume uploaded before they save it and they can view the uploaded resume for double checking before saving. and after saving the the resume file should be sbale to view by clicking it and the resume will show. 
- additional infos at the profile page where in, there should be a skills, eduvational background etc. so that when the employee will view the applicants profile tehre will be already important details they will see before they even look at the resume.
- the notification should be realtime like for example the employee did something to the applicants applicaton it should be already notified to the applicant notifs ame as to the applicant when the applicant submitted a application to the employer it should also notified the employee.
- i dont know if a user for example loged in as an applicant and another different user log in, I am not sure if those 2 user opens the same page.
- the user can upload and take a profile picture. the user either upload a picture form the local device or take a new picture.
- at the application form of the applicant, the upload resume should be able to open/view.
- for example at the main page of the applicant page, when the user already submited an application one oof the posted jobs, when it is redirect at the main page again after submiting the application the job applied card should be display or there will be noted there such as "You already applied to this job" and when the user click the view job where the user already submitted an application instead of apply now there should be "apply again" and "review submittend application"
- at the applicant page, in the your saved jobs page, the apply now button should be clickable same as at the main page. as if it is the same as the main page job cards.
- the search bar was not working properly
- at the sign up account page, it should be strict at the format such as the name@gmail.com the correct format, bt when the user type namegmail.com(invalid email) etc.
