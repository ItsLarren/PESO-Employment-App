those html file are working but compare each other, the app.html fils was workimg but doesnt have a page at the profile page, unlike at the app2.html it has a profile page and can efit the edit information button but the problem it the other buttons at the main page are not working

on the main page of the employee it will bee the application of the applied applicants at bottom noav of the employee main page instead of "saved jobs" it should be "saved applicant application" something like that. and at the applications when the user(employee) click the appwoved or reject r save button, it will be removed to the list and will go at the saved applicants, and when I click the schedule interview a new page will show and it has a form for a number of the applicant that is from the resume, a mesage on where, what, how, when will be the interview will take plce and who the employee is
